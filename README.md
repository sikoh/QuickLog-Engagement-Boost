# QuickLog Engagement Boost - A/B testing project

### Goal:
To determine if adding a "Quick Log" button to the home screen of the FitTrack fitness app increases the number of users who log their workouts daily, thereby improving user engagement.

### Data:
- Source: Simulated data representing 3 months of user activity
- Sample size: 10,000 users
- Time period: 90 days
- Control group: 5,000 users without the Quick Log button
- Treatment group: 5,000 users with the Quick Log button

### Findings:
1. Average Daily Active Users (DAU):
   - Control group (without Quick Log): 2702.06
   - Treatment group (with Quick Log): 3383.31

2. Statistical Analysis:
   - T-statistic: -7.2872
   - P-value: 9.9151e-12 (extremely small)

3. Percentage Improvement: 25.21%

### Evaluation:
The extremely low p-value (9.9151e-12) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting that the difference between the two groups is not due to chance. The negative t-statistic (-7.2872) confirms that the control group (without Quick Log) had significantly lower engagement than the treatment group.

### Results:
1. Statistical Significance: The difference in user engagement between the two groups is statistically significant.

2. Positive Impact: The Quick Log button improved daily active users by an average of 681.25 users per day (3383.31 - 2702.06).

3. Substantial Improvement: The treatment group showed a 25.21% increase in daily active users compared to the control group.

### Interpretation:
The addition of the Quick Log button on the home screen of the FitTrack app has led to a significant and substantial increase in user engagement. The improvement from 2702.06 to 3383.31 average daily active users represents a considerable boost in app usage and workout logging behavior.

### Conclusion:
Based on these results, we can confidently conclude that the Quick Log button is an effective feature for increasing user engagement. The significant improvement in daily active users (from 2702.06 to 3383.31) suggests that this feature makes it easier and more convenient for users to log their workouts, thereby encouraging more frequent app usage.

### Recommendation:
Given the strong positive results, it is recommended to implement the Quick Log button for all users of the FitTrack app. This change is expected to drive higher engagement rates across the entire user base, potentially leading to improved user retention and satisfaction.

### Next Steps:
1. Roll out the Quick Log button to all users.
2. Continue monitoring user engagement to ensure the improvement persists over time.
3. Conduct follow-up studies to understand the long-term impact on user retention and overall app satisfaction.
4. Explore additional features or improvements that could further enhance user engagement based on the success of this initiative.
5. Investigate if the increase in engagement varies across different user segments (e.g., new users vs. long-term users, frequent vs. infrequent users) to tailor future improvements.
